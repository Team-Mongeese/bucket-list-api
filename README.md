We began with a team meeting to nail down our process. We assigned roles and pairs to handle the frontends and backend.
In pairs, we assigned a pilot and a navigator. We first completed the routes and models. We initially had issues restricting viewing to just the owners of the resources but made a decision to leave that as a reach goal.
After completing the back end we deployed it so that the front end team could incorporate both parts.
